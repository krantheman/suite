# Context Map

Suite is one app made of several products. Each keeps its own domain language.
This map lists the contexts that have one written down, and how they meet.
The repository-wide dependency and interface rules are in
[`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Contexts

- [Drive](./suite/drive/CONTEXT.md) — stores the site's files as a
  permissioned tree, and lends that tree to the other products
- [Mail](./suite/mail/CONTEXT.md) — the email client for the mail accounts
  each user holds on the site's mail server
- [Meet](./suite/meet/CONTEXT.md) — persistent rooms for live audio, video,
  screen sharing, and recording
- [Suite shell](./frontend/CONTEXT.md) — the frame every product renders
  inside: rail, contextual panel, content pane

Not charted yet: Writer, Sheets, Slides, Calendar, Suite Core.

## Relationships

- **Writer → Drive**: a Writer document has a Drive Node standing for it, and
  its embedded images are Drive Nodes beneath that node.
- **Slides → Drive**: a deck has a Drive Node standing for it. Its media are
  framework attachments today, authorized by their own endpoint. Moving them
  under the deck node is decided but not built.
- **Sheets → Drive**: a sheet has a Drive Node standing for it. Its change
  log and collab state stay with Sheets as the document body. Its versions,
  comments, title, and trash state are Drive's.
- **Meet → Drive**: a Recording Artifact becomes a file in Drive. A Recording
  Budget is a reservation held against the Room Owner's Personal Root while a
  Recording Session runs, and counts as that root's usage.
- **Mail → Drive**: compose attachments land in one Drive folder that all
  users may add to, and stay there.
- **Calendar → Meet**: a scheduled event's remaining time sets the Recording
  Estimate shown before a Recording Session starts.

Every product above uses Drive for storage and sharing through the public
`suite.drive` interface. Drive imports none of their implementations. The
Content Type declaration is an inverted dependency: each content product owns
an adapter such as `suite/writer/drive.py`, and Suite composition registers it
with Drive. Drive holds the title, place, grants, lifecycle, versions, and
comments; the product holds the body.
